                    CFDs are leveraged products. CFD trading may not be suitable
                    for everyone and can result in losses that exceed your
                    initial investment. Please ensure that you fully understand
                    the risks involved.

                  <div>
                    In light of the risks involved, you should undertake such
                    transactions only if you understand the nature of the
                    contracts (and contractual relationships) into which you are
                    entering and the extent of your exposure to the risks.
                    Trading in CFDs may not be suitable for many members of the
                    public. You should carefully consider whether such trading
                    is appropriate for you in light of your experience,
                    objectives, financial resources, and other relevant
                    circumstances. In considering whether to trade, please be
                    aware of the margin requirements, commissions, fees, and
                    other charges for which you will be liable. These charges
                    will affect your net profit (if any) or increase your loss.
