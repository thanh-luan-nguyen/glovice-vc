									<p id="answer12" style="display: none;">You have just completed your registration with Glovice VC; What should you do next? Don't worry, we've put together a simple guide for you.
										Steps to follow these steps after registration: <br>
										&nbsp; 1. Create a demo/live account <br>
										&nbsp; 2. Download the trading platform <br>
										&nbsp; 3. Complete information verification*(If you skip the verification steps during registration) <br>
										<b>Create a demo/live account </b> <br>
										&nbsp;- You can create a live or demo trading account when registering a Glovice VC account by default.
										We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the process of creating a new trading account. <br>
										&nbsp;- In the “My Account” section there are tabs called “Live Accounts” and “Demo Accounts.”
										You can see a button called “Create Live Account” on the right when clicking the
										“Live Account tab” and vice
										versa for “Demo Account.” when clicking on this icon, the system will display all types of trading
										accounts that you can create (on MT4, Micro or Standard accounts, etc.) <br>
										&nbsp;- You can open the account by fulfilling all the necessary information and following the steps. <br>
										<b>Download the trading platform </b> <br>
										&nbsp; To trade with your created trading account, you will have to use a trading terminal on your chosen platform.
										Here is a list of all available terminals and platforms: <br>

										<!-- &nbsp; Computer <br>
																&nbsp; MetaTrader 4 for Windows <br>
																&nbsp; Mobile device <br>
																&nbsp; MetaTrader 4 for iOS <br>
																&nbsp; MetaTrader 4 for Android <br> -->
										<b>Complete information verification</b> <br>
										We attach great importance to fully verifying your Glovice VC account, as limits are placed on accounts that are not fully verified. <br>
										To verify, you need to submit verification of identity (POI), verification of address (POA), and complete a Financial Profile,
										a short survey about your trading experience.
										We have 24/5 support staff to verify your documents within 24 hours. <br>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<button onclick="showOrHidden('answer13')">1.3. What should I do if my verification documents are not in my name?</button>
									<p id="answer13" style="display: none;"> If you are the account holder, your verification must be in your own legal name
										and not in anyone else's name. If the documents are found to be incorrect, the account may be locked so it is important
										that you correct them as soon as possible. <br>
										Please contact our Support Team via ChatBot (bottom right of your screen) or other channels or email as soon as possible with your account
										verification information. <br>

								</li>
								<li>
									<button onclick="showOrHidden('answer14')">1.4. How do I check if my account is ready to deposit and trade?</button>
									<p id="answer14" style="display: none;"> When you sign up for a Glovice VC account with Glovice VC, you can choose
										to create a demo account or a live account during registration. <br>
										If you want to fund your Live account and start trading, you need to complete the following steps: <br>
										1. Email verification <br>
										2. Fill in your personal information <br>
										3. Upload KYC documents including Identity Verification documents and Address Verification documents <br>


									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<button onclick="showOrHidden('answer15')">1.5. How do I verify my account if I open an account overseas?</button>
									<p id="answer15" style="display: none;"> Before going into detail on how to handle this situation, we recommend that you always open an account in your country of permanent residence. If you are on vacation or traveling abroad, please wait until you return home before opening an account. <br>
										To facilitate the account verification process, you will need to verify your phone number and address, both of which must match the country you are registered in. <br>
										As a result, if you open an account in a country where you are only temporary, you may face difficulties later (when you have to complete the account verification process). <br>
										Now let's learn about how to verify your account if you are registered abroad: <br>
										<b>POI (Document of Identity Verification)</b>
										To complete the POI verification process, you should always provide identification issued in your country. This step does not consider the country you have registered your account with and where you are currently residing. <br>
										Let's look at a few examples of this: <br>
										• If you are a Malaysian citizen living in India and have opened an account there, you will need to provide identification issued by the Malaysian government to verify the POI. <br>
										• If you are an Indian citizen registered for a Glovice VC account in Pakistan and currently undergoing the verification process in South Africa, you will still need to provide an ID issued by the Indian government. <br>
										<b>POA (Document of Verification of Address) </b>
										To complete the POA verification process, you will need to provide an address verification document issued in the country where you have registered your account. <br>
										Let's take a look at some examples below: <br>
										• If you are an Indian citizen registered for an account in South Africa, you must provide proof of address issued in South Africa. <br>
										• If you are an Indian citizen who has registered a Glovice VC account in India and is currently undergoing the verification process in South Africa, you will still need to provide an address verification document issued in India. The reason is that you have selected India as your country of residence during the account opening process. If you have moved to live permanently in South Africa, open a new account in South Africa. <br>
										If you move to another country after verification, contact our Support Team to change the address on your account. Always keep your account up to date with the most accurate information. <br>

									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<button onclick="showOrHidden('answer16')">1.6. How do I change the name used when registering?</button>
									<p id="answer16" style="display: none;"> When you sign up for an account with Glovice VC, you will need to enter some personal details such as your name and date of birth. You may have accidentally entered a nickname or worse, made a typo. <br>
										In this article, we'll show you what to do when you want: <br>
										• Fixed typo when registering <br>
										• Change the name used when registering <br>
										<b> Fixed typo when registering </b>
										Our experts always name the account the same as it appears on the documents uploaded during the registration process. If you mistyped your name, you should do the following: <br>
										1. Submit identification with your exact name. <br>
										2. Make sure the documents meet our requirements. <br>
										3. Once approved, your account name will be edited to match the document. <br>
										4. If you wish, you can also email us to notify us of the necessary changes. <br>
										Change the name used when registering <br>
										• Registered under someone else's name - We always ask you to provide correct information when registering an account. If you have registered with an incorrect name or someone else's name, this name will not be accepted. During the verification process, your documents will be rejected due to name mismatch. <br>
										Solution: Sign up again with the correct credentials and with a different email address. <br>
										• Valid name change - If you've changed your valid name, we can help you properly rename your account. <br>
										Solution: Send an email to the support team with proof of name change and new ID. Accordingly, you will also need to upload identity verification documents to your Glovice VC account again. Once approved, your account registration name will be revised. <br>

										For the Standard Account, we provide the spread from 1. Furthermore, both Standard and Micro account offers 0.01 lots allowing for much smaller trading volumes which means less risk exposure; in other words, you will have more chances of "correction". <br>

									<button onclick="showOrHidden('answer42')">4.2. I got the error ""Authentication failed"" on the trading terminal?</button>
									<p id="answer42" style="display: none;">
										<b>A common cause of this error is entering incorrect credentials on terminals for the Android platform.</b> <br>
										<b>Please make sure:</b> <br>
										&nbsp; • The account number has been entered correctly. <br>
										&nbsp; • The correct master password has been entered. <br>
										&nbsp; • Sele1cted the correct server type your account is using. <br>

									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<button onclick="showOrHidden('answer43')">4.3. I'm getting the error ""Invalid account""?</button>
									<p id="answer43" style="display: none;">Let's look at a few possible reasons for the error. <br>
										<b>Login information is incorrect</b> <br>
										You can confirm your account number in your Glovice FX account. Under “My Account,” the number of your trading account is displayed with the MT4 label and a Live or Demo tab. Confirm that this account number and the number you used to sign in are the same. <br>
										<b>incorrect password</b> <br>
										Make sure you use the correct Master Password when logging in. If you forget your password, you can change it in your Glovice FX account under My Account. Click on the gear icon on the right side of the account and select "Master Password" to generate a new password. Use this new password and try logging in again. <br>
										<b>Incorrect server </b> <br>
										If it is a live account, the server would be KJGlovice-Live. On the other hand, if it is a demo account, the server would be KJGlovice-Demo. Next time you log in, you can confirm that your server is correct. <br>

									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<button onclick="showOrHidden('answer44')">4.4. New Order button is disabled?</button>
									<p id="answer44" style="display: none;">If you’ve been able to log in to your trading account, but the New Order button appears grayed out and inactive, it is likely you are logged in with read-only access. <br>
										Read-only access (investor mode)is a mode in which one can observe a trading account in real-time, but all trading actions are disabled. <br>
										You might enter this mode by accidentally entering the investor password instead of the master password. <br>
										You can quickly verify this by looking in the Journal tab of your trading terminal for an entry that says “trading has been disabled - investor mode”. <br>
										If this message is shown, click File > Login to Trade Account and enter in your master account password. The trading terminal will now show the New Order button as active and usable. <br>
										Otherwise, go to your Glovice FX account-My account and click the Gear button-Master account button if you would like to change your master account password. You can then use the new master password to log in to your trading account. <br>

									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<button onclick="showOrHidden('answer45')">4.5. I get the error message 'Not enough funds'?</button>
									<p id="answer45" style="display: none;">This error occurs when a trader attempts to open trade but there aren’t enough funds to cover its costs; check details about the margin and spread the cost of a trade action for more.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<button onclick="showOrHidden('answer46')">4.6. Old version error?</button>
									<p id="answer46" style="display: none;">This error occurs because you are using an old version of the MetaTrader platform. To fix this issue, upgrade to the latest version and restart your platform.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<button onclick="showOrHidden('answer47')">4.7. Why is my account name showing wrong when I login to MT4?</button>
									<p id="answer47" style="display: none;">If you set up your account nickname in languages other than English (or those that use non-Latin letters), please make sure you set up corresponding encoding/codepage for the Windows OS. MT4 does not support Unicode which may give rise to such errors when being used in Windows.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<button onclick="showOrHidden('answer48')">4.8. Market is closed?</button>
									<p id="answer48" style="display: none;">If you are seeing this error, you are probably trying to trade when the forex market is closed.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<button onclick="showOrHidden('answer49')">4.9. I get the error "Transaction not allowed"</button>
									<p id="answer49" style="display: none;">The likely cause of this error is that you are logged into your account with a Read-Only Password (Investor mode). The investor password is used to share your account with others while disabling all trade functions. <br>
										<b>Follow these steps to solve the error:</b> <br>
										&nbsp; Log out of the trading terminal. <br>
										&nbsp; Log back into the trading terminal with your master password. <br>
										Attempt to trade again.
